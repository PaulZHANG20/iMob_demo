# How to Install Python Dependency
Go to the root directory and then

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
# Working flow
Before running, make sure the python dependency packages have been installed.
Python IDE such as Pycharm is also recommended for running imob.
```
cd <installation directory>
python Run_Imob.py
```
The main interface of iMoB is displayed as follows:
